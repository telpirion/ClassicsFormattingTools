# Formatting tools for classics texts

This repo contains tools built to reformat the XML versions of classical
language texts (Latin, Ancient Greek) available from the
[Perseus Project](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/).

Ultimately, the goal is to transcribe select parts of the Perseus' library
from XML to a lighter weight JSON format, which should be easier for apps
to parse.
